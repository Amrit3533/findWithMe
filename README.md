## 📂 File Structure

The project is contained within a single `index.html` file for simplicity. The internal structure is organized as follows:

````

index.html
├── \<head\>
│   ├── Meta Tags (Viewport, Charset)
│   ├── Title
│   ├── Bootstrap 5 CSS Link
│   ├── Font Awesome CSS Link
│   ├── Google Fonts Link
│   └── \<style\> (Custom CSS)
│
├── \<body\>
│   ├── \<header\> (Navigation Bar)
│   ├── \<main\>
│   │   ├── Hero Section (with search form)
│   │   └── Job Listings Section
│   ├── \<footer\>
│   ├── Bootstrap 5 JS Bundle Link
│   └── \<script\> (Custom JavaScript)


* **Custom CSS**: All custom styles are located within the `<style>` tags in the `<head>` section.
* **JavaScript Logic**: The core application logic, including the job data, rendering functions, and event listeners, is located within the `<script>` tags just before the closing `</body>` tag.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* **Connect to a Real API**: Replace the hardcoded `jobsData` array with `fetch()` calls to a live job board API.
* **Job Detail Pages**: Create separate pages or modals to show more details for each job listing.
* **User Authentication**: Add functionality for users to sign up, log in, and save their favorite jobs.
* **Pagination**: Implement pagination for the job listings to handle a large number of results efficiently.
* **Theme Toggle**: Add a dark/light mode toggle for improved user experience.
